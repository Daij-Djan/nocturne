========

Fork of blacktree-nocturne from  http://code.google.com/p/blacktree-nocturne/ -- now 10.10 ready and 64 bit and a revamped UI

I added some features:
- hotkey support
- launch-at-login
- streamlined UI
- **rewrote code for the light sensor**
- added support for dark mode
- **the app is now 64 bit conform **

- removed warnings & refactored code a lot to make it more readable and more extendable

*Note: this fork is not done of course. Pull requests would be welcome*
